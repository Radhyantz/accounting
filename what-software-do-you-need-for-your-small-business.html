Obviously knowing where the money is<br>coming from and going is essential to running your business. <br>That's why it is good to find out which small business<br>accounting software is best for you to help you run a well<br>organized and efficient small business.  <br><br>There are hundreds to thousands of small business accounting<br>software out there to help you with reports and tools needed to<br>use your financial data.  Depending on the one you go with will<br>depend on how much you're going to pay for it.  The more you<br>pay, the more accessories and programs there will be that come<br>with it.  Some come with a billing and time module, various<br>amounts of financial and management reports, and more.  You can<br>choose to get it in different editions from basic, online, pro,<br>or premier for your computer.<br><br>One small business accounting software that is recommended is<br>the 2005 Peachtree Complete Accounting.  This is a multi-user<br>ready system that provides you with all the features needed. <br>You'll have features including in-depth inventory, job costing,<br>time and billing, fixed assets and more.  With all these great<br>features the price of this runs between $165-$290 as it is sold<br>by different merchants.  You can shop for this product through<br>the different merchants here:<br><br>http://about.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=2936006/search=Peachtree%20Complete<br><br>Another feature that is offered with certain software is the<br>capability to scale as your business grows.  That is just one of<br>the many features that the high end Microsoft Business Solutions<br>Small Business Financials North America Edition offers.  Also<br>included in this program is the capability of keeping record of<br>financial management, sales, purchasing, inventory, payroll, and<br>reporting.  This is software that will easily allow you to run<br>an organized small business and keep track of the people in it<br>and all of the numbers associated with running a small business.<br><br>This software will give you everything that you'll truly need. <br>With this high end software is a hefty price as it runs between<br>$995-4,500, so you'll have to decide how big your small business<br>is going to get.  If you're going to be running a large small<br>business, then this will be worth it to help keep track of all<br>the payrolls and inventory and more.  On the website listed<br>below, you'll also see a free 60-day CD demo that you can try it<br>out first to see if you like it. <br><br>http://www.2020software.com/products/Microsoft_Business_Solutions_Small_Business_Financials_North_America_Edition.asp<br><br>There is plenty more software to choose from, but there's a high<br>end software and a cheaper software to check out.  If you go to<br>http://www.2020software.com/default.asp you'll find a list of<br>what this website claims the top 7 software out there.  Included<br>on this list is the Microsoft software I have briefly talked<br>about just above.  <br><br>This list is going to consist of the more expensive software out<br>there.  All of the software on the list is priced at above<br>$1,000 with some of them reaching the $100,000 mark.  While it<br>is pricey, it will install very easily, be very secure over the<br>internet and computer, and offer all kinds of features you<br>wouldn't even consider such as a built-in report writer to help<br>deliver the content in the format you need. <br><br>Now you know the general price range for accounting software and<br>the features you'll get for what you pay for.  In order to get a<br>good quality software for your small business it's going to be<br>pricey, but it will help keep your business organized and in<br>tact.  So don't be afraid to drop some money on software that<br>will help expand your business in the long run.<br><br><br>
