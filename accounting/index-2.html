      They Exist?</b></font><br>
      &nbsp;by: <font color="#FF6600"><b class="author">John Day</b> </font>
      <p>Who created accounting principles? Who sets and revises accounting 
      standards? What if you don’t follow all the rules, do you go to jail? Is 
      there an accounting police force that investigates and arrests violators? 
      It would seem that there must be some regulatory force to make sure that 
      providers of financial statements conform to the rules. There is, up to a 
      point, and here is how it works: </p>
      <p>Mainly, it’s all voluntary and it works pretty well. First, 
      double-entry accounting originated in Italy in the 1400’s, so its been 
      around awhile. Accounting principles have evolved over the years just as 
      have accounting standards. The reason why the system works is that the 
      business community could not function if there was not commonality and 
      consistency in financial statement reporting. It would be chaos, much like 
      if there were no driving rules of the road. </p>
      <p>Therefore, in the United States, a body of experts known as the 
      Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB pronounced Fasbee) was 
      established in 1973, which superseded another board called the Accounting 
      Principles Board (APB). The FASB members go through a lengthy process of 
      analyzing and reviewing problems in the accounting field that are brought 
      to them. After much thought, they will make a pronouncement as to what 
      they think the new or revised way of approaching the treatment of an 
      accounting issue should be. </p>
      <p>They are a non-governmental organization that has private financing. A 
      big supporter of FASB is the American Institute of Certified Public 
      Accountants (AICPA). Many Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) belong to 
      this prestigious organization and are obligated to abide by its guidelines 
      and principles of behavior. Other countries no doubt have similar 
      organizations that require high levels of accounting professional conduct.
      </p>
      <p>FASB established an accounting code called “Generally Accepted 
      Accounting Principles” or (GAAP). The assumption is that if a business 
      financial statement is prepared according to GAAP, then the user of that 
      financial statement could rely on or trust the information more readily 
      than if not prepared according to GAAP. Those businesses that deviate from 
      GAAP, and many smaller businesses do, cannot say that their statements are 
      prepared under GAAP; in fact, they should inform the reader that they are 
      not. However, let the buyer beware. </p>
      <p>One governmental body that has a policing function is the Securities 
      Exchange Commission (SEC). It is primarily concerned with public companies 
      because their job is to protect investors from unscrupulous acts. 
      Recently, the SEC has gotten into the act of establishing accounting 
      standards. It has its hands full today. </p>
      <p>Since most businesses use their financial statements to prepare their 
      required income tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may audit 
      those tax returns and review the financial statements upon which the tax 
      returns are based. Not following the rules can get you in trouble with 
      this governmental body. </p>
      <p>You can see that in many ways compliance to the principles and 
      standards is a mixture of voluntary and regulatory behavior. Currently, 
      there is an effort underway to set international accounting standards due 
      to the inexorable globalization process. This is a massive undertaking 
      that will take years, but it is obviously necessary and inevitable.</td>
