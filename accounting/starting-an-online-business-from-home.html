If you are already familiar with what product you will sell you will need to create or hire someone to produce an online website for you. This website should list the product or products you have available. If you will be selling your own products, make sure that your online business has a name that reflects you and what you offer. <br><br>After this has been completed, you should inquire in your local state to learn the guidelines necessary for you to run a business from your home. Many states require that even an online business register with them and receive a business license. You will have to get the necessary forms to request this license. <br><br>After you have obtained you license, you should also find out how running an online business from home will affect you tax situation. You would still need to report any income you make from your business, even if you are working at home. <br><br>After all this paperwork is completed for you business, it is important to set up your home office for you new job. It is suggested that you have a separate space to conduct <br>your business affairs. A separate phone line that customers can call is also very necessary and I strongly suggest you get a fax machine. You will lose customers if you are not able to be reached by telephone, fax and e-mail. Having a separate phone line from the rest of the house is essential!<br><br>Other than a second phone line, it is also a good idea to buy the necessary hardware and software for you home office. You will save lots of money if you have your own fax machine, scanner, and printer. Also it is probably wise to have the latest software additions for word processing and accounting. The accounting software is especially useful for you to keep track of all expenses and revenue for your online business. <br><br>When you have established the business and things are going well, it is a good idea to consider outsourcing. This would mean hiring someone to take care of the little jobs that <br>you would have to do such as email or letter correspondence or creating marketing brochures. By doing this, you will be able to focus on the more important areas of making money and marketing your business, which will be key to your success. <br><br>Copyright 2005 Burke Publications All Rights Reserved
