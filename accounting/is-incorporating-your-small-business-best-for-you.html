              <td align="left" height="12"><span class="style2">There comes a point in time when every small business person<br>contemplates on whether to incorporate their business or not.  A<br>lot of times small businesses start out sole proprietorships,<br>and then become incorporated as the business expands and<br>develops.  Small business incorporating can be a difficult<br>decision, and with this article you’ll gain a little bit of<br>knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>There are many advantages to incorporating your small business,<br>but limited liability is one of the biggest advantages.  When<br>you have sole proprietorship to the company all the liability of<br>the company is on the owner.  When incorporating the business,<br>your only liability is to however much you invest in the company.<br><br>With sole proprietorship, all of your personal belongings, such<br>as car and home, can be turned over to help pay the debt of the<br>business.  As a shareholder in the business, you have no<br>responsibility whatsoever for the debts of the business, that is<br>of course unless you give a guarantee.<br><br>Another advantage to incorporating a small business is the<br>ability to raise money so much easier.  With the ability to<br>raise money much easier, this increases the odds of the<br>corporation growing and expanding.  Yes, you’re saying any sole<br>proprietorship can borrow money and incur debt like any<br>corporation.  However, with a corporation you can sell shares<br>and raise equity capital, which is a big advantage in that you<br>generally don’t have to repay equity capital and it has no<br>interest.<br><br>There are many tax advantages with becoming a corporation that<br>you can take a look at as well.  Some of these advantages<br>include income splitting, potential tax deferral and more. <br>Along with the reasons above, a corporation can have an<br>unlimited life.  The life of a corporation is not dependent on<br>particular individuals, but the company as a whole.  With this,<br>the company has the opportunity of lasting forever just as long<br>merges with another company or goes bankrupt.<br><br>Now that I’ve buttered up the idea of incorporating your small<br>business, let’s take a look at some of the possible negatives.<br><br>As you incorporate your small business, there now will be two<br>tax returns to file each year, one for your personal income and<br>one for the corporation.  This may not be a huge deal, but<br>unlike a sole proprietorship a corporation cannot deduct its<br>losses from the personal income of the owner.  Plus, having<br>another tax return is the last thing another business owner<br>wants to deal with.<br><br>As a corporation is much larger and more complex then a small<br>business, therefore the cost to create one is much higher.  Just<br>to set up the corporation will cost a lot more, then you have to<br>tack on the increased maintenance fees, accounting fees, and<br>more.<br><br>As with everything else, a larger business means more paperwork<br>that must be taken care of.  Corporations must keep a minute<br>book, which contains the corporate bylaws and minutes from<br>corporate meetings.  Reports and tax returns must be completed<br>neatly and in a timely fashion.  All of the business bank<br>accounts and records have to be kept separate from personal<br>accounts and assets.  That may sound like a load, but that is<br>just the start of the increased paperwork that comes with the<br>territory of incorporating your small business.<br><br>While there are many advantages and disadvantages to<br>incorporating your small business, the decision ultimately goes<br>to you.  It is a decision that could make or break your<br>business, therefore much more research is recommended.  However,<br>small business incorporating should be a thing that suites you<br>and others associated with you best.<br><br><br>
